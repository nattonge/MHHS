Mental Health Help-Seeking Preferences in College Students



INFORMED CONSENT FORM

RESEARCH PROCEDURES

This research is being conducted to assess mental health help-seeking preferences in college students. If you agree to participate, you will be asked to complete a series of surveys about mental health and personality and answer questions about who you would be most likely to talk to about your mental health. It will take about 90 minutes to complete this study.



RISKS

The foreseeable risks or discomforts include mild psychological distress related to answering questions about mental health. This distress is expected to be no more than what you may experience discussing these topics with a family member, friend, or healthcare provider.

There is always a slight chance that someone might feel upset after completing the survey; however, it is important to know that there are no expected risks or negative effects associated with your involvement.

If you experience psychological distress, please consider contacting the GMU Center for Psychological Service's FREE Emotional Support Line at 703-215-1898. Trained providers are available every day from 8:30 AM – 8:30 PM to offer help, teach evidence-based skills, and listen. Resources for low-cost or sliding scale therapy sessions are also available upon request.

Loss of confidentiality is an unlikely but possible risk in any study involving collection of personally identifiable information. While it is understood that no computer transmission can be perfectly secure, reasonable efforts will be made to protect the confidentiality of your transmission, as described below (""Confidentiality"").

There is a risk that you could become bored or fatigued while completing the study surveys. You are welcome to take a break at any time while completing the study to minimize boredom and fatigue.



BENEFITS

There are no benefits to you as a participant other than to further research about help-seeking for mental health.



CONFIDENTIALITY

The data in this study will be confidential. If you decide that you do not wish to participate in this study, we will delete any information about you from our database as soon as possible and typically within 5 business days.

If you agree to participate in this study, every reasonable effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the information you share with the study team (that is, to protect this information from being seen by individuals with whom you do not consent to share it). While it is understood that no computer transmission can be perfectly secure, reasonable efforts will be made to protect the confidentiality of your transmission. We take the following steps to help maintain your confidentiality:

Your name and email address is provided by Sona when you sign up for a study timeslot and this information stays in Sona. This information is periodically deleted by the Sona team. Your questionnaire responses will be collected using Qualtrics, Qualtrics maintains the highest security standards, including encrypted data transfer (preventing hacker interception), password-required access to data, and a secure survey environment (writing responses directly to their computer server, leaving no trace on participants’ computers). See Qualtrics.com for more details on confidentiality and security.

When you consent, Qualtrics will record a unique StudyID provided by Sona. Your name, email address, and StudyID will be downloaded from Sona and stored in a password-protected file, on a folder within Mason’s OneDrive network that is accessible only by IRB-approved research team members. Your data in Qualtrics will only contain the StudyID and not your name, email address, or any other identifying information.

When we analyze your data, only the StudyID will be included in our analysis files, not your name, email, or anything else that could be used to link your identity to the research data. Your de-identified data (labeled only with the StudyID) will be stored in our database indefinitely for future analysis. We also keep this data so that other scientists who want to double-check our work can do so (but we never give other scientists who aren't part of the research study your name or contact information). The de-identified data could be used for future research without additional consent from participants.

When the results of the research are published or discussed in conferences, no information will be included that would reveal your identity.

The Institutional Review Board (IRB) committee that monitors research on human subjects may inspect study records during internal auditing procedures and are required to keep all information confidential.



How long do we keep your data?

·       For all participants who complete the study: We maintain a list of participants who complete or partially complete this study. The list includes your Name, Email Address and StudyID. We will temporarily use this list to determine if you completed the study so that we can award appropriate credit in Sona. We keep this list separate from the rest of your data, and the list contains no other information about you.

·       If you agree to be contacted about future research opportunities (see below, ""Contact for Future Studies""), we will keep your Name, Email address, and StudyID in a password-protected file that is separate from your data until you indicate that you would like your information removed. You may contact us to ask for your information to be removed using any of the contact methods listed in this form (see below, ""Contact""). In the event that the contact information you provided ceases to be valid, we will also remove you from the linking file.

·       If you indicate that you do not wish to be contacted about future research opportunities (see below, ""Contact for Future Studies""), we will remove your Name and Email Address from the password-protected file at the end of the current academic semester/session. This is to ensure that credit can be properly awarded for participation. Your name and email address will be deleted from any other files that would link your responses to your identity. At that point, your data is ""de-identified,"" meaning that we no longer have any way to match up your questionnaire responses to your identity. Once the semester/session is over and credit is awarded, your data with your survey responses will only be labeled with a unique StudyID.



PARTICIPATION

In order to participate in this study, you must have English language fluency sufficient to complete the consent and survey, must have regular access to the internet, and must have access to a SONA systems account. Participants cannot participate in this study more than once.

Your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason. If you decide not to participate or if you withdraw from the study, there is no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. There are no costs to you or any other party.

You will receive 1.5 SONA research credits for completion of the study. If you withdraw from the study before completing more than 50% of the survey, you will receive research credit proportionate to survey completion (minimum 0.5 credits). If agree to participate in this study, but decide not to complete all the survey forms, the researchers may continue to use de-identified information you provided on the surveys prior to that choice. To have your data withdrawn, you can contact the Principal Investigator (see below, ""Contact"") and ask for your data to be removed from the dataset and the data itself destroyed. If you decide you no longer wish for us to have your data, you should contact us as soon as possible; if your entry in the linking file connecting your data to your identity has already been destroyed (see above, ""Confidentiality""), we will not be able to locate the data belonging to you and so will not be able to destroy it.



ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATION

If you choose not to participate in a research study for SONA course credit, please consult with your professor on alternative activities you may complete for course credit.

CONSENT

Below you will have the option to agree to participate in the research study, if you agree to future contact about future studies, or to tell us that you do not want to participate and would like for us to delete your contact information from our database.



CONSENT TO CONTACT FOR FUTURE STUDIES

Your responses to the surveys included in this study may indicate that you are eligible to participate in an ongoing or future study conducted by our lab. We may wish to contact you in the future to invite you to participate. Giving your permission for us to contact you again does not obligate you to answer any future questions or to participate in any future research - you will always retain the right to decline further participation in research.","CONSENT
